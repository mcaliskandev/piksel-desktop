# Config Backend (Where settings live)

A place to persist and load preferences.  
Could be JSON, .ini, or your own format.  

DE needs to remember user choices across sessions.  

Things like:  
Panel height  
Launcher icon size  
Wallpaper path  
Theme name  
Autostart apps  

DE’s “brain” storage.
